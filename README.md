# inputTest
a module for use in game engines that stores 'moves' in a 'move tree.' when player input is recieved, it traverses the tree to see what actions, if any, should be taken.

this allows for arbitrarily complex move-sets, particularly useful in fighting games where lengthy input sequences can result in actions vastly different than the mere sequence of buttons pressed would perform on their own.
